# Live Camera Edge Detection

This project uses Python and OpenCV to perform edge detection on a live camera feed. The program captures video from the default webcam, applies an edge detection algorithm, and displays both the original video and the processed edge-detected output in real-time.

## Features
- Captures video from the default webcam.
- Performs edge detection using OpenCV.
- Displays both the original feed and edge-detected output side by side.
- Allows the user to exit the program by pressing the `q` key.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenCV library

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/edge-detection.git
